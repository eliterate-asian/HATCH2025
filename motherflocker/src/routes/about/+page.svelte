<h1>About</h1>
<h4>Release 0.1</h4>
<p>Honey bees <i>Apis mellifera</i> represent and incredibly important keystone species for our society and way of life. 
We rely on the pollination efforts of these mighty little insects, and we can attribute nearly a third of our agricultural
success to their hard work. But even beyond habitat and environmental mismanagement, bees are threatened by an altogether
more sinister foe: the varrao mite.<br><br>

This tool seeks to support apiaries and the fight against the mites by leveraging AI techonology and the collaborative reserach 
efforts of local beekeepers to find, track, and maintain the health of colonies.
